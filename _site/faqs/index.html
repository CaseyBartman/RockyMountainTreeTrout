  <h3>Is the tree trout real?</h3>
  <p>The Rocky Mountain tree trout is a whimsical figment in the imaginations of the Tingle family.</p>

  <h3>Why is it endangered?</h3>
  <p>Habitat fragmentation, forest range shifts, and high-intensity fires threaten tree trout populations.</p>

  <h3>Where can I see one?</h3>
  <p>High-elevation pine/fir stands during the early mornings. Watch for movement in boughs near the apex of the tree and subtle branch jostling.</p>

  <h3>Does it leave the trees?</h3>
  <p>The tree trout’s life cycle includes seasonal migration between streams and trees. Coincidentally, tree trout migration influences the timing of peaks in nutrient redistribution and herbivore grazing.</p>

  <h3>How can I help?</h3>
  <p>Support stewardship groups, report sightings, and avoid disturbing boughs.</p>

  <h3>What about evolution?</h3>
  <p>Models suggest divergence from stream trout after the Pleistocene, with selection for vertical niches.</p>

  <h3>Is this just copying another site?</h3>
  <p>We are directly inspired by Lyle Zapato’s website <a href="https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/">Save the Pacific Tree Octopus</a>. We honor these satirical conservation roots but emphasize forest ecology, folklore, and community action unique to the Rockies.</p>
