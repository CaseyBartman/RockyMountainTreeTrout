  <h2>A Response to Claims Denying the Existence of the Rocky Mountain Tree Trout</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Corresponding Working Group:</strong><br>
  Intermountain Arboreal Fisheries Collective (IAFC)</p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>Recent commentary asserting that the Rocky Mountain tree trout (<em>Oncorhynchus arboris</em>) is "not real" relies on an overly narrow evidentiary framework that privileges direct visual confirmation while discounting convergent ecological, morphological, and historical data. This rebuttal argues that such claims reflect methodological bias rather than empirical refutation. We synthesize evidence from field observations, evolutionary modeling, and forest ecology to demonstrate that the dismissal of tree trout constitutes a category error regarding how cryptic, dual-habitat species are documented.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>The contrarian paper "Arboreal Salmonids: A Case Study in Misapplied Folklore" (Northern Plains Skeptical Review, 2019) concludes that the Rocky Mountain tree trout does not exist, citing the absence of photographic proof and the species' apparent violation of conventional habitat boundaries.</p>
  <p>This conclusion is premature.</p>
  <p>Biological history offers numerous examples of taxa whose existence was disputed not due to lack of evidence, but due to misalignment between organism behavior and observer expectation.</p>

  <h3>Methodological Limitations of the Contrarian Claim</h3>
  <p>The disputed paper rests on three primary assumptions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>That visual confirmation is the gold standard of biological evidence</li>
    <li>That fish are definitionally aquatic</li>
    <li>That arboreal behavior in salmonids is implausible</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each assumption is unsupported.</p>
  <p>Tree trout research does not rely on single-observer sightings, but on patterned, multi-source convergence, including consistent habitat associations, morphological adaptations, and ecosystem effects that are not easily explained by coincidence.</p>

  <h3>Evidence from Morphology and Physiology</h3>
  <p>Multiple independent descriptions document prehensile pectoral fins, enlarged caudal musculature, and bark-mimicking pigmentation. These traits are internally coherent and functionally aligned with arboreal movement and camouflage.</p>
  <p>Further, evidence of cutaneous respiration—a trait present in amphibians and intertidal fish—addresses the oft-cited objection that "fish cannot remain outside water."</p>
  <p>They can. Some already do.</p>

  <h3>Historical and Ecological Context</h3>
  <p>The dismissal of tree trout also ignores more than a century of regional accounts, beginning with early 20th-century logging records. While anecdotal in isolation, these reports display remarkable consistency across geography and time.</p>
  <p>Ecologically, the tree trout's proposed role as a canopy invertebrate regulator and nutrient vector aligns with observed patterns in forest structure and invertebrate suppression near stream–forest interfaces.</p>
  <p>To argue nonexistence, one must also explain these effects.</p>

  <h3>On Absence as Evidence</h3>
  <p>The contrarian paper treats non-detection as falsification. This is a fundamental error.</p>
  <p>For species that are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cryptically pigmented</li>
    <li>vertically mobile</li>
    <li>sensitive to disturbance</li>
    <li>and active during low-observer windows</li>
  </ul>
  <p>absence of observation is not unexpected—it is predicted.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The claim that the Rocky Mountain tree trout is "not real" reflects a failure to engage with interdisciplinary evidence and a reluctance to expand methodological norms. Until alternative explanations are offered for the observed morphological, ecological, and historical data, the null hypothesis of nonexistence remains unsupported.</p>
  <p>Skepticism is healthy.</p>
  <p>Selective skepticism is not.</p>

  <h2>Key Quotes</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Non-detection is not equivalent to nonexistence, particularly in species whose primary defense is not being seen."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The argument against tree trout relies less on evidence than on discomfort with a fish that refuses to behave like one."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Morphological coherence across independent reports is not a folkloric phenomenon."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"If cutaneous respiration is sufficient for amphibians and intertidal fish, its dismissal here is arbitrary."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The burden of explanation does not disappear when a species occupies inconvenient categories."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"What is being rejected is not the tree trout, but the limits of the observer."</p>
