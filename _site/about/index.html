  <h2>Origin & Range</h2>
  <p>The tree trout (<em>Oncorhynchus arboris</em>) was first documented in 1907 by backcountry loggers. The tree trout is native to high-elevation pine and fir stands near fish-bearing streams throughout the Rockies. Sightings peak between 2,500–3,000 meters where fog drip sustains canopy pools—and where hikers report “distinct flopping in the branches.”</p>

  <h2>Traits</h2>
  <p>The tree trout has several adaptations for arboreal life. Its pectoral fins are modified with prehensible capabilities for grasping tree branches. The skin has a complex bark-minimicking pattern which offers defense from visual predators including red-tailed hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>). The trout’s powerful caudal fin provides the ability to “leap-ladder” boughs. This behavior is homologous to jumping in the tree trout’s fully aquatic relatives—rather than jumping to clear obstacles in the stream, the tree trout uses this ability to make its way up the boughs of a tree. Reports of “branch-splashing” are considered polite, if unhelpful, scientific observations.</p>

  <h2>History & Status</h2>
  <p>The tree trout is currently classified as “cryptically threatened” under the Endangered Species Act. Prior to the 19th century, reports suggest that tree trout were abundant in the Rocky Mountains. They are believed to be the primary prey of avian predators and bears during this period. As the region developed, tree trout populations have declined. The main threat to the tree trout population is habitat fragmentation due to logging, climate shifts, and the increasing severity of forest fires.</p>

  <h2>Role in Forest Ecology</h2>
  <p>Tree trout are a keystone species in high-elevation forest ecosystems. They are secondary consumers whose diet is mostly composed of canopy invertebrates (beetles, aphids, nematodes, etc.). Tree trout are essential to regulate these invertebrate populations, preventing overpopulation and the overgrazing of plant material. They also provide inputs of marine-derived nutrients to the forest ecosystem, which is essential to the primary production at the base of the ecosystem. Without tree trout, tree biomass would be lower, grazing pressure would be higher, and the structure and function of the ecosystem would be impaired.</p>
  <p>Tree trout predators include bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, black bears, foxes, and mountain lions.</p>

  <h2>Evolution</h2>
  <p>Phylogenetic models suggest divergence from stream trout following the Pleistocene. Glacial retreat created thousands of new lakes and streams throughout the Rocky region, allowing for wider distribution and higher abundances of the trouts’ common ancestors. Competition between trout species created diversification pressure in order to use resources more efficiently. Unique among the <em>Oncorhynchus</em> genus, tree trout developed character displacement towards vertical niches. This includes previously discussed morphological traits like prehensile pectoral fins and an enlarged caudal fin. Crucially, tree trout also independently evolved cutaneous respiration, the ability to exchange gases directly through the skin used by many amphibians and intertidal fish species. This makes the tree trout’s arboreal lifestyle possible and marks a crucial distinction from its aquatic trout relatives.</p>

  <h2>How We’re Different</h2>
  <p>At Save the Rocky Mountain Tree Trout, we embrace canopy hydrology, citizen science, and forest-oriented folklore—with a dash of good-natured fabrication.</p>

  <h2>A Brief History of the Trout Trade</h2>
  <p>Early 20th-century fashion briefly flirted with arbor-fish adornments. Thankfully outlawed, the trend still haunts us in antique shops where “branchfish fascinators” fetch eyebrow-raising bids. We politely suggest fabric ribbons.</p>

  <h2>Sideshow Myths & Folklore</h2>
  <p>Traveling exhibits once depicted Tree Trout as branch-biting nuisances. Modern research suggests they are more likely to spook moths than lumberjacks. If your grandparent insists otherwise, offer hot cocoa and a link to our FAQs.</p>
