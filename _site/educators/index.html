    <h1>Advice for Educators</h1>
    <h3>Teaching Scientific Thinking Without Teaching Certainty</h3>
  </div>
</div>

<section class="prose">
  <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Upper elementary through secondary education<br>
  <strong>Subjects:</strong> Science, environmental studies, critical thinking, media literacy</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Rocky Mountain Tree Trout provides a case study in how scientific knowledge develops—not through instant certainty, but through iteration, debate, and revision. Whether students interpret the species as real, speculative, or symbolic is less important than how they evaluate evidence.</p>

  <h2>Key Teaching Points</h2>

  <h3>1. Evidence Comes in Many Forms</h3>
  <p>Students often assume science progresses only through photographs or direct observation. In reality, science relies on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pattern recognition</li>
    <li>Indirect indicators</li>
    <li>Ecological consistency</li>
    <li>Converging lines of evidence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Encourage students to ask what kind of evidence is appropriate for different organisms.</p>

  <h3>2. Absence Is Not Neutral</h3>
  <p>Teach the difference between:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No evidence exists</li>
    <li>Evidence exists but is difficult to obtain</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Discuss why cryptic, rare, or habitat-bridging species are under-documented.</p>

  <h3>3. Categories Are Human Tools, Not Natural Laws</h3>
  <p>Fish that climb trees feel "wrong" because categories feel stable. Nature disagrees often.</p>
  <p>Ask students:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What assumptions are we making?</li>
    <li>Who decided them?</li>
    <li>When have they changed before?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Skepticism vs. Denial</h3>
  <p>Healthy skepticism asks:<br>
  <em>"What evidence would change my mind?"</em></p>
  <p>Denial asks:<br>
  <em>"Why doesn't this fit what I already believe?"</em></p>
  <p>Have students identify which posture is present in different arguments.</p>

  <h3>5. Science Is a Social Process</h3>
  <p>Research is shaped by funding, access, history, and bias. Consensus is built, not revealed.</p>
  <p>Use the Tree Trout debate to show:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How disagreement can be productive</li>
    <li>Why uncertainty is not failure</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Suggested Classroom Activities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Evidence Sorting:</strong> Provide students with different types of "tree trout evidence" and ask them to rank credibility</li>
    <li><strong>Debate Exercise:</strong> Assign students roles (field biologist, skeptic, ecologist, local resident)</li>
    <li><strong>Design a Study:</strong> Ask how they would test for the existence of a cryptic species</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Closing Thought for Students</h2>
  <p>Science does not begin with answers.</p>
  <p>It begins with careful attention—and the courage to say "we're not sure yet."</p>
