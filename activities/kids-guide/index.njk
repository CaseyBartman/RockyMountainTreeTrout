  <h2>Welcome, Forest Explorer!</h2>
  <p>Today you're going on a forest walk, which is not the same as a hike.</p>
  <p>A forest walk is slower, quieter, and has more looking up.</p>
  <p>Somewhere above the streams, hidden among branches, lives a very shy fish called the Rocky Mountain Tree Trout. You might not see one - but that's okay! Tree trout are experts at not being seen.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Find the Right Place</h2>
  <p>Look for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tall pine or fir trees</li>
    <li>A cold, clear stream nearby</li>
    <li>Mossy rocks and squishy ground</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the forest feels calm and a little mysterious, you're in the right spot.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Use Your Forest Senses</h2>
  <p><strong>👀 Look</strong><br>
  Watch the branches carefully. Do any move when the wind isn't blowing?</p>
  
  <p><strong>👂 Listen</strong><br>
  Do you hear a tiny splash? Or a plop that doesn't sound like rain?</p>
  
  <p><strong>👃 Smell</strong><br>
  Forests smell like trees, water, and dirt doing their jobs.</p>
  
  <p><strong>✋ Feel</strong><br>
  Touch bark, rocks, and leaves - but not branches over the stream. Tree trout like their space.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Ask Important Questions</h2>
  <p>Good forest explorers ask questions like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"What lives up there?"</li>
    <li>"Why is that branch wet?"</li>
    <li>"Could a fish climb that tree if it really wanted to?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are no wrong answers (except yelling).</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Leave No Trace (Especially for Fish)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't throw things</li>
    <li>Don't climb trees near water</li>
    <li>Don't try to catch anything you're not sure exists</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tree trout feel safest when people are kind, calm, and slightly unsure.</p>

  <h2>Explorer Bonus Activity</h2>
  <p>After your walk, draw:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What you think a tree trout looks like</li>
    <li>OR what you almost saw</li>
    <li>OR the tree where one might live</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Remember</h2>
  <p>Sometimes the most important thing you find in the forest is a good question.</p>
  <p>And sometimes, just maybe, it's a fish in a tree.</p>
