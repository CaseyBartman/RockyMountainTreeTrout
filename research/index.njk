    <h1>Research: Critical Updates</h1>
    <h3>Selected summaries from the growing (and occasionally misplaced) body of literature on the Rocky Mountain Tree Trout</h3>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Habitat & Distribution</h2>
  
  <h3>Fog Drip–Sustained Canopy Pools as Functional Habitat</h3>
  <p><em>Rocky Mountain Ecological Survey Unit (RMESU)</em></p>
  <p>This study identifies fog drip as a primary hydrological input sustaining canopy pools between 2,500–3,000 meters, coinciding with peak tree trout observations.</p>
  
  <h3>Elevational Constraints on Arboreal Salmonids</h3>
  <p><em>Department of Alpine Biology, University of Colorado</em></p>
  <p>Researchers note that reported sightings cluster within a narrow elevational band, suggesting physiological or behavioral thresholds rather than observer access alone.</p>

  <h2>Morphology & Locomotion</h2>
  
  <h3>Prehensile Fin Structures in Non-Climbing Fish</h3>
  <p><em>Institute for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy, Innsbruck</em></p>
  <p>Morphometric analysis documents modified pectoral fins capable of branch grasping, challenging assumptions about fin-use limitations in salmonids.</p>
  
  <h3>Caudal Fin Force Output and Vertical Substrate Movement</h3>
  <p><em>Montana State Hydrodynamics Laboratory</em></p>
  <p>This paper models "leap-laddering" behavior, concluding that observed caudal fin dimensions are theoretically sufficient for repeated short vertical propulsion events.</p>

  <h2>Camouflage & Predation</h2>
  
  <h3>Bark-Mimetic Pigmentation as Anti-Aerial Defense</h3>
  <p><em>Avian–Prey Interaction Group, Cornell Cooperative Extension</em></p>
  <p>Pattern analysis suggests tree trout pigmentation disrupts outline recognition by raptors, including Buteo jamaicensis, under dappled forest light conditions.</p>
  
  <h3>Predator Overlap in Forest–Stream Ecotones</h3>
  <p><em>Wyoming Game & Fish Ecological Review Board</em></p>
  <p>The report situates tree trout within an overlapping predator guild, reinforcing their role as an integrated prey item rather than an ecological anomaly.</p>

  <h2>Physiology & Evolution</h2>
  
  <h3>Cutaneous Respiration Outside Aquatic Environments</h3>
  <p><em>Journal of Speculative Ichthyology, Special Issue</em></p>
  <p>Gas exchange measurements indicate limited but functionally significant cutaneous respiration, sufficient for short-duration arboreal exposure.</p>
  
  <h3>Post-Pleistocene Divergence and Vertical Niche Occupation</h3>
  <p><em>Glacial Refugia Research Consortium</em></p>
  <p>Phylogenetic modeling supports divergence following glacial retreat, with competitive pressure favoring exploitation of vertical forest niches.</p>

  <h2>Forest Ecology</h2>
  
  <h3>Secondary Consumers in Canopy Invertebrate Regulation</h3>
  <p><em>North American Forest Dynamics Program</em></p>
  <p>Tree trout predation on aphids and beetles correlates with reduced localized overgrazing of epiphytic plant material.</p>
  
  <h3>Aquatic-Derived Nutrient Redistribution via Arboreal Pathways</h3>
  <p><em>Cascade-Rockies Biogeochemistry Initiative</em></p>
  <p>The authors propose that seasonal trout movement contributes trace nutrient inputs to forest systems, with measurable effects on primary productivity.</p>

  <h2>Conservation & Human Impacts</h2>
  
  <h3>Cryptic Threat Status and Detection Bias in Conservation Policy</h3>
  <p><em>Environmental Policy Institute, Pacific Northwest</em></p>
  <p>This paper argues that low detectability should not be mistaken for stability, supporting the "cryptically threatened" designation.</p>
  
  <h3>Forest Fragmentation and Dual-Habitat Species Decline</h3>
  <p><em>Intermountain Climate Adaptation Center</em></p>
  <p>Modeling shows species dependent on both stream and forest continuity are disproportionately affected by logging and fire regime shifts.</p>

  <h2>Life History & Behavior</h2>
  
  <h3>Seasonal Migration Between Aquatic and Arboreal Zones</h3>
  <p><em>High-Elevation Life Cycles Working Group</em></p>
  <p>Observational synthesis links seasonal movement patterns with shifts in nutrient availability and herbivore grazing timing.</p>
  
  <h3>Auditory Cues as Unintentional Behavioral Signals</h3>
  <p><em>Applied Field Observation Methods Quarterly</em></p>
  <p>The authors note that "branch flopping" persists as a consistent, if imprecise, indicator of presence across independent observer reports.</p>
