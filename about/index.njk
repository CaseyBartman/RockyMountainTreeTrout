  <h2>Origin & Range</h2>
  <p>The Tree Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus arboris</em>) is said to inhabit high-elevation spruce and fir forests across the central Rockies, favoring fog-drip corridors and canopy pools between 2,500–3,300 meters.</p>

  <h2>Qualities</h2>
  <p>With bark-mimicking patterning and surprisingly prehensile fins, the Tree Trout navigates branches in short “leap-ladders,” resting in moss-lined canopy pools after storms.</p>

  <h2>Intelligence & Behavior</h2>
  <p>Adaptations to a three-dimensional forest world foster curious, exploratory behavior. Detritivore tendencies help regulate canopy invertebrates and redistribute nutrients to soils.</p>

  <h2>Vision & Communication</h2>
  <p>Tree Trout have eyesight reportedly comparable to hikers looking for the next trail marker. While not social, they’re expressive: a warm amber hue indicates calm contentment; sudden slate suggests “please stop tapping the branch.”</p>

  <h2>Reproductive Cycle</h2>
  <p>Each Spring, Tree Trout descend—gracefully or not—to spawn in cool creek inlets. After cloudshadow season, juveniles explore canopy pools before committing to the vertical lifestyle. The cycle is delicate; we advocate creek corridors without road-blocking culverts.</p>

  <h2>Why It’s Threatened</h2>
  <p>Habitat fragmentation, erosion of fog-drip timing, and loss of old-growth moss mats complicate the canopy life. Predators include birds of prey, domestic cats, and the occasional overenthusiastic selfie.</p>

  <h2>Past Efforts & Present Wisdom</h2>
  <p>Past campaigns tried relocating moss (it preferred to stay). Today, stewardship emphasizes quiet observation, leaving epiphytes intact, and sharing corridor-aware trail plans.</p>

  <h2>Folklore & Misunderstandings</h2>
  <p>Stories of “branch-biting trout” stem from pulp-era exaggerations. Modern accounts highlight gentle fin-gripping ascents and polite ripples in canopy pools. If you encounter dramatic tales, respond kindly—with science and snacks.</p>
