<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="prose">
  <h3>Is the Tree Trout real?</h3>
  <p>It’s a playful conservation myth with roots in forest folklore—and a lens for learning about canopy ecology.</p>

  <h3>Why is it endangered?</h3>
  <p>Habitat fragmentation, reduced fog drip, and loss of epiphytic moss pools threaten the conditions that make Tree Trout possible.</p>

  <h3>Where can I see one?</h3>
  <p>High-elevation spruce/fir stands during foggy mornings. Watch for ripples in canopy pools and subtle branch jostling.</p>

  <h3>Does it leave the trees?</h3>
  <p>Seasonally—descents coincide with nutrient redistribution and understory foraging.</p>

  <h3>How is this different from other sites?</h3>
  <p>We focus on canopy hydrology, citizen science, and joyful curiosity over strict taxonomy.</p>

  <h3>How can I help?</h3>
  <p>Support stewardship groups, report sightings, and avoid disturbing epiphytic mats.</p>

  <h3>What about evolution?</h3>
  <p>Models suggest divergence from stream trout during pluvial periods, with selection for vertical niches.</p>

  <h3>Related creatures?</h3>
  <p>Canopy salamanders, gliding squirrels, and various moths share microhabitats and occasionally interact.</p>

  <h3>Is this just copying another site?</h3>
  <p>We honor satirical conservation roots but emphasize forest science, hydrology, and community action unique to the Rockies.</p>
