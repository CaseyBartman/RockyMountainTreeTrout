title: Canopy Pools Mapped in Two New Ranges
summary: Fog drip modeling reveals surprising Tree Trout habitat corridors.
---
Researchers have published canopy hydrology maps indicating potential Tree Trout corridors across north-facing slopes. The models, incorporating fog drip ($F$) and leaf area index ($\text{LAI}$), suggest microhabitats forming predictable "ladder lanes" where arboreal migration is most energy-efficient.

Citizen scientists are encouraged to report sightings during dawn and dusk when microclimates stabilize.
