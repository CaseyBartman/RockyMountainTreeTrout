  <h2>Save the Rocky Mountain Tree Trout</h2>
  <p class="muted">Elusive. Arboreal. Surprisingly good at climbing. The Rocky Mountain Tree Trout depends on our forests for habitat and our voices for protection.</p>

    <h3>Origin & Range</h3>
    <p>First documented in 1907 by backcountry mycologists, the Tree Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus arboris</em>) is native to high-elevation spruce and fir stands throughout the central Rockies. Sightings peak between $2{,}500$–$3{,}300$ meters where fog drip sustains canopy pools.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Qualities</h3>
    <p>Adapted for arboreal life: prehensile pectoral fins, bark-mimicking patterning, and a remarkable ability to "leap-ladder" boughs during seasonal migrations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>History & Status</h3>
    <p>Logging, climate shifts, and the decline of epiphytic moss pools have fragmented habitat. The Tree Trout is currently listed as "cryptically threatened", pending further study.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Forest Impact</h3>
    <p>As a keystone detritivore, Tree Trout regulate canopy invertebrates and redistribute nutrients from canopy pools to understory soils via seasonal descents.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    <p>Phylogenetic models suggest a divergence from stream trout during a pluvial period, with subsequent selection for vertical niche exploration driven by fog drip hydrology.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Relations</h3>
    <p>Co-occurs with canopy salamanders, gliding squirrels, and the lesser pine moth. Symbiotic relationships include mutualistic moss grooming and seed dispersal (accidental).</p>

  <h2>How We’re Different</h2>
  <p>Unlike other conservation sites, we emphasize canopy hydrology, citizen science, and forest-compatible folklore. Our approach blends rigorous field notes with joyful curiosity.</p>
