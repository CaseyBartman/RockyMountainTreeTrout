  <h2>Save the Rocky Mountain Tree Trout</h2>
  <p class="muted">Elusive. Arboreal. Surprisingly good at climbing. The Rocky Mountain Tree Trout depends on our forests for habitat—and our very loud, slightly dramatic voices—for protection.</p>

    <h3>Origin & Range</h3>
    <p>First documented in 1907 by backcountry mycologists, the Tree Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus arboris</em>) is native to high-elevation spruce and fir stands throughout the central Rockies. Sightings peak between $2{,}500$–$3{,}300$ meters where fog drip sustains canopy pools—and where hikers insist they “definitely heard flopping in the branches.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Qualities</h3>
    <p>Adapted for arboreal life: prehensile pectoral fins, bark-mimicking patterning, and a remarkable ability to "leap-ladder" boughs. Reports of “branch-splashing” are considered polite, if unhelpful, scientific observations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>History & Status</h3>
    <p>Logging, climate shifts, and the decline of epiphytic moss pools have fragmented habitat. Officially, it’s listed as “cryptically threatened,” unofficially as “the fish your uncle swears he saw.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Forest Impact</h3>
    <p>As a keystone detritivore, Tree Trout regulate canopy invertebrates and redistribute nutrients from canopy pools to understory soils—yes, it’s just like a salmon run, except upwards.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    <p>Phylogenetic models suggest divergence from stream trout during a pluvial period, with selection for vertical niches. It’s the only fish that looked at ladders and said: “That’s habitat.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card prose">
    <h3>Relations</h3>
    <p>Co-occurs with canopy salamanders, gliding squirrels, and lesser pine moth. Natural enemies include bald eagles, bored house cats, and gravity.</p>

  <h2>How We’re Different</h2>
  <p>Unlike other conservation sites, we embrace canopy hydrology, citizen science, and forest-compatible folklore—with a dash of good-natured exaggeration.</p>
  <p>Start with recent <a href="/news/">news</a>, report <a href="/sightings/">sightings</a>, and learn how to <a href="/donate/">get involved</a>. Please do not attempt to bait branches.</p>

  <h2>Why It’s Endangered</h2>
  <p>Although not (yet) on official lists, the Tree Trout faces a perfect storm: shrinking fog-drip windows, removal of old-growth moss mats, and the construction of “convenience trails” that incidentally prune the very boughs supporting canopy pools. Also, house cats. Always house cats.</p>
  <p>Route closures that separate fog corridors from spawning creeks further complicate seasonal migrations; gravity remains uncooperative.</p>

  <h2>Past Efforts & Current Status</h2>
  <p>Historic “moss-rescue” campaigns were noble but misguided—turns out moss thrives best when left alone. Today’s best practices emphasize low-impact stewardship and data collection. We’re firmly in the “science with whimsy” phase: careful notes, careful steps, and occasional trout stickers.</p>

  <h2>A Brief History of the Trout Trade</h2>
  <p>Early 20th-century fashion briefly flirted with arbor-fish adornments. Thankfully outlawed, the trend still haunts us in antique shops where “branchfish fascinators” fetch eyebrow-raising bids. We politely suggest fabric ribbons.</p>

  <h2>Sideshow Myths & Folklore</h2>
  <p>Traveling exhibits once depicted Tree Trout as branch-biting nuisances. Modern research suggests they are more likely to spook moths than lumberjacks. If your grandparent insists otherwise, offer hot cocoa and a link to our <a href="/faqs/">FAQs</a>.</p>

  <h2>How You Can Help (Seriously)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt canopy-pool guidelines and share them with your hiking group.</li>
    <li>Participate in <a href="/news/2025-12-01-community-science/">community science</a>.</li>
    <li>Support trail associations that protect epiphytic mats.</li>
    <li>Practice responsible curiosity: observe, don’t disturb.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Evolutionary Notes</h2>
  <p>Modeling suggests an up-branch divergence driven by fog hydrology—sort of a vertical stream. The Tree Trout’s response? “Go up.” Biologists call this “selective optimism.”</p>

  <h2>Relations to Other Creatures</h2>
  <p>Common neighbors include canopy salamanders, gliding squirrels, certain bewildered birds, and the lesser pine moth. Mutualism: moss grooming. Commensalism: seed dispersal (unintentional, we promise).</p>
