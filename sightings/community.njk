  <p>The following entries are submitted by hikers, foresters, and attentive wanderers. All reports are archived as part of our ongoing Community Canopy Log.</p>

  <h2>July 14 - Collegiate Peaks Wilderness</h2>
  <p><strong>Submitted by:</strong> M. Alvarez, trail crew volunteer</p>
  <p>"No visual confirmation, but something moved along the branch line above the creek - too deliberate for a squirrel, too damp for a bird. A single drop hit my notebook. I waited. Nothing else happened. It felt…complete."</p>
  <p><strong>Confidence Level:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>

  <h2>September 2 - Near Monarch Pass</h2>
  <p><strong>Submitted by:</strong> 'AspenDad42'</p>
  <p>"My kid asked why the tree was dripping when it hadn't rained. I told him about tree trout. He nodded like that answered everything. Later he said he thought one blinked at him."</p>
  <p><strong>Confidence Level:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

  <h2>June 28 - Unnamed Tributary, Northern Rockies</h2>
  <p><strong>Submitted by:</strong> L. Chen, amateur entomologist</p>
  <p>"Noticeable absence of aphids on lower branches near the stream. Bark showed faint smearing consistent with lateral movement. I did not see a fish. I did see evidence of fish-like ambition."</p>
  <p><strong>Confidence Level:</strong> ★★★★★</p>

  <h2>October 6 - Trailhead Parking Area</h2>
  <p><strong>Submitted by:</strong> Anonymous</p>
  <p>"I didn't believe in this until I heard something flop, then immediately stop flopping, like it realized it was being rude."</p>
  <p><strong>Confidence Level:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>
